# Function Fix for Linux
This program was created to fix the function keys defaulting to media keys on Mac based keyboards.

NOTE: This has only been tested on Arch, Fedora 34, and Debian 11

# Dependencies:
Java 8 or better

# Instructions:


# Jar file:

Type `sudo java -jar functionFix.jar`

    the reason that we need "sudo" is that the directory is in a restricted area


# Source Code Compilation:

Clone `https://github.com/dagem/function-fix.git`


Type `javac Function.java`


Run `sudo java Function`

    sudo for the same reasons as above
